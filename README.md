This is the README file of my final project in the frontend development class

The project needs to be done between week 7 to week 10 (total of 5 3-hour classes) of the class.

A Profile page has a cube with six faces showing my work experiences, projects, education, hobbies, contact, and a comment page for people to leave me feedbacks. The cube is built based upon a 3D Cube Image Gallery found on CSS-Tricks.com. I edited it to use bootstrap buttons in place of radio buttons, and added mouse movement with javascript and jQuery. Mouse movement is handled by jquery.event.drag javascript. Work experiences, projects, and education are loaded by Ajax, so in case more items added to these categories, I can simply just add texts to the json file that contains the relavant information. Also loaded with Disqus for people to leave comments about myself or this profile page.
